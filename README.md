# Formal Regression
A new method for regression on the polynomial function that makes up the data.

## 1. Introduce

From a minimum number of points (including coordinates and values) of a polynomial function. We can use them to regress to the original equation. 

This algorithm works on the principle of the canonical equation of the [Hit Sum Function](https://github.com/Truongphi20/sumfor#introduction-to-the-hit-sum-function). When a canonical calculation is performed once, the degree of the function will decrease by one order. Continue execution until the result consists of only the same constants. Take the 'outermost' values and do the calculation with the Hit Sum function by [The polynomial function generating algorithm](https://github.com/Truongphi20/sumfor), the result is the initial function of the data.
